**Project description:**

In this project we describe the game of random movement of pacman or several pacman created by clicking a button by the user and then put them in random movement at random speed where in case they hit the edges of the screen, they bounce and stay in their movement within the web page. 

**How it is executed:**

We describe the game of random movement of the pacmen in the following steps:

 -We create a Pacman by button click action and move this pacman across the page. 

-After that we add another pacman by clicking the `Add Pacman` button and it appears in a random position on the screen. And you can add the number of Pacman that the user wants. 

-Then by clicking on the `Start Game` button, the created pacman or pacmen start moving randomly at a random speed on the screen. 

-Finally when a given Pacman reaches any edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

But you can see all the code in the following link: <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pjvalverde/PacMen-Exercise/blob/main/index.html">Pacmen Exercise</a>



**Roadmap of Future Improvments:**

Pacman can be designed to go through a maze similar to the one shown in the Atari game of the 80s. You could also make a simulation of hunting for ghosts. One could also see an application to crash physics by observing the collisions between the pacmen and the edges of the screen.
